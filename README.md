# Fake News Detection System

This project detects whether a given news article is Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Real-time user input prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF)

## How It Works
1. News text is cleaned and normalized
2. Text is converted into TF-IDF numerical vectors
3. A machine learning model is trained on labeled data
4. New news articles are classified as Fake or Real

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
python fake_news_detector.py
